I decided that it was high time to engage in the creation of a blog, if for no other reason than I feel
a desire to connect more fully with the amazing community of Clojure hackers and other folks who have so
greatly enhanced my own life by sharing freely of their awesomeness. My hope is that having a blog will
imbue this vague desire with some discipline, and that I will start taking the time and effort to engage
in venues where blog posts might be read by others.

The first post-worthy adventure I have found myself on is actually setting myself up with a blog that is
easy enough for me to maintain that I might **actually do it**. I ended up using a combination of:

-   Github Pages for hosting
-   Org-more and org-export-md to produce content, and
-   A local Jekyll install running in auto-refresh mode for content development and testing

It's taken some work, but now it's super-easy and fun to use. In this post, I will detail how I got it that way.
